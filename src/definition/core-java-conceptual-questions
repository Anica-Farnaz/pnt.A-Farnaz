Please answer the below core-java Questions:

What is programing language?
A.
A programming language is a type of written language that tells computers what to do.



What jdk contains or composed of and define each components?
A.Java Runtime Environment (JRE), An interpreter/loader (Java), A compiler (javac), An archiver (jar) and many more
The Java Runtime Environment, or JRE, is a software layer that runs on top of a computer’s operating system software and provides the class libraries and other resources that a specific Java program needs to run.
Interpreter in Java is a computer program that converts high-level program statement into Assembly Level Language.
The language processor that reads the complete source program written in high-level language as a whole in one go and translates it into an equivalent program in machine language is called a Compiler
Java archive (JAR) is a file format that contains bundled Java class files along with associated image/sound files, resources and metadata.

What is IDE?
A.An integrated development environment (IDE) is software for building applications that combines common developer tools into a single graphical user interface (GUI).



What are the IDEs available in the market to support java?
A.
 Eclipse,IntelliJ IDEA, NetBeans, BlueJ,(Oracle) JDeveloper, DrJava,jGRASP, MyEclipse,Xcode,Codenvy
Explain the entire java life cycle.
There are three main stages in the life cycle of a java program. They are:
Editing the program
Compiling the source code
Executing the byte code
First, you will start with typing the program in a text-editor (ex: notepad, notepad++, wordpad, textedit etc). After completing editing of the program, we have to save the file. While saving the file you should remember that the file must be saved with .java extension. For example, let’s think that I had written a Java program which contains a single class Sample (more on classes in future posts). It is a good convention to save the file with the name of the class. So, as per my example, the file will be saved as Sample.java.
Second step is compilation. The name of the Java compiler is javac. The input to the compiler is Java source code which is available in Sample.java. The output of the compiler is machine independent or platform independent code which is known as bytecode. The file which is generated after compilation is .class file. As per my example, the bytecode file will be Sample.class.
Last step is execution. The bytecode generated by the compiler will be executed by Java Virtual Machine (JVM). Input to the JVM is bytecode and output is machine code (0’s and 1’s) which will be executed by the CPU of the local machine.

what is class?
A class is a blueprint used to create objects and to define object data types and methods

What is object?
An object is an instance of a class.

What is the entry point of an application?
The Main method.

Why main is static?
The main() method is static so that JVM can invoke it without instantiating the class.

Which class is the superclass of all classes?
The Object Class

What is difference between path and classpath variables?
The main difference between PATH and CLASSPATH is that Path is set for java tools in java programs like java and javac, which are used to compile your code. Whereas CLASSPATH is used by System or Application class loader to locate and load compile Java bytecodes stored in the . class file.

What is the difference between an Interface and Abstract class?
An abstract class allows you to create functionality that subclasses can implement or override. An interface only allows you to define functionality, not implement it.

Can you make an Object from an Interface and Abstract class ? if not how do you use it ?
You cannot create an object of abstract class or interface since they are incomplete class (interface is not even considered as a class.)
What you can do is to implement a subclass of abstract class which, of course, must not be abstract. For interface, you must create a class which implement the interface and implement bodies of interface methods.

what is Access Specifier?
Access Specifier help us to restrict the scope or visibility of a package, class, constructor, methods, variables, or other data members.

What is OOP ? Define each feature of java OOP.
Object Oriented Programming  is a computer programming model that organizes software design around data, or objects, rather than functions and logic.
Abstraction:It is data hiding.Abstraction is selecting data from a larger pool to show only relevant details of the object to the user.
Encapsulation:Encapsulation in Java is a mechanism of wrapping the data (variables) and code acting on the data (methods) together as a single unit.
Inheritance:Inheritance in Java is a mechanism in which one object acquires all the properties and behaviors of a parent object.
Polymorphism:Polymorphism means "many forms", and it occurs when we have many classes that are related to each other by inheritance.

What is Java Package and which package is imported by default?
A package in Java is used to group related classes
java.lang package

What is API? Name list of API that you have used so far.
API stands for application programming interface—a set of definitions and protocols to build and integrate application software.
1. Weather Snippets.2. Log-in Using XYZ.3.Pay with PayPal.4.Twitter Bots.5. Travel Booking

Does java support multiple inheritance, explain why or why not?
no.Java supports multiple inheritance through interfaces only. A class can implement any number of interfaces but can extend only one class. Multiple inheritance is not supported because it leads to deadly diamond problem

What is method overloading and when it happens?
Overloading occurs when two or more methods in one class have the same method name but different parameters. Overriding occurs when two methods have the same method name and parameters. One of the methods is in the parent class, and the other is in the child class.

Explain exceptions in java and how to handle it.
Exception is an unwanted or unexpected event, which occurs during the execution of a program i.e at run time, that disrupts the normal flow of the program's instructions.
1.Try Catch 2. Throws

What is static keyword in java? How it has been used in variables and methods ?
 the keyword static means that the particular member belongs to a type itself, rather than to an instance of that type.
 We can create static variables at the class level only.Static method can only directly call other static methods.

What is final and how it has been used variables and methods?
Using the final keyword means that the value can’t be modified in the future.
When a variable is declared with the final keyword, its value can’t be modified, essentially, a constant.
A final method cannot be overridden.

What is final, finally and finalize?
sing the final keyword means that the value can’t be modified in the future
finally defines a block of code we use along with the try keyword.
The Java finalize() method of Object class is a method that the Garbage Collector always calls just before the deletion/destroying the object which is eligible for Garbage Collection to perform clean-up activity.

What is a constructor ?
A constructor in Java is similar to a method that is invoked when an object of the class is created.

Can we have multiple constructors in a class?
yes
If we don't have a constructor declared, what is called during the object creation?
Default Constructor.

What is "this" keyword in java ?
The this keyword refers to the current object in a method or constructor.It is a reference Variable.

What is "super" keyword in java? How many possible way can you use?
The super keyword in Java is a reference variable which is used to refer immediate parent class object
super can be used to refer immediate parent class instance variable,parent class method,parent class constructor.

Is JVM platform independent?
no

What version of java are you using?
java 8
What is JAR stand for ?
JAR stands for Java ARchive

What is the difference between JDK and JVM?
ava Development Kit (JDK) is a software development environment used for developing Java applications and applets.
The Java Runtime Environment provides the minimum requirements for executing a Java application.

What is the difference between JVM and JRE?
JVM is Java Virtual Machine -- the JVM actually runs Java bytecode.
The Java Runtime Environment provides the minimum requirements for executing a Java application.

What is compile time and run time?
Compile time is the period when the programming code (such as C#, Java, C, Python) is converted to the machine code (i.e. binary code). Runtime is the period of time when a program is running and generally occurs after compile time.

What is heap?
 A heap is a specialized tree-based data structure that satisfied the heap property: if B is a child node of A, then key(A) ≥ key(B).

How java manage it's memory?
Java uses an automatic memory management system called a garbage collector.

What is the difference between String, StringBuffer and StringBuilder?
Strings are objects that are a sequence of characters.
A string buffer is like a String , but can be modified.
StringBuilder in Java is a class used to create a mutable, or in other words, a modifiable succession of characters.

What is Singleton class?
 Singleton is a design pattern that ensures that a class can only have one object.

What is Serialization and Deserialization?
Serialization is a mechanism of converting the state of an object into a byte stream. Deserialization is the reverse process where the byte stream is used to recreate the actual Java object in memory.

When to use transient variable in java?
Transient in Java is used to indicate that a field should not be part of the serialization process.

Difference between while and do..while loop?
While loop checks the condition first and then executes the statement(s), whereas do while loop will execute the statement(s) at least once, then the condition is checked.

What is Enum?
An enum is a special "class" that represents a group of constants (unchangeable variables, like final variables).

What is Iterator?
An Iterator is an object that can be used to loop through collections, like ArrayList and HashSet.

Which one will take more memory, an int or Integer?
Integer

Why is String Immutable in Java?
 The string is Immutable in Java because String objects are cached in the String pool.

What is constructor chaining in Java?
Constructor chaining is the process of calling a sequence of constructors.

The difference between Serial and Parallel Garbage Collector?
serial garbage collector uses a single thread for garbage collection process while the parallel garbage collector uses multiple threads for the garbage collection.

What is JIT stands for?
Just In Time

Explain Java Heap space and Garbage collection?
Heap space is used for the dynamic memory allocation of Java objects and JRE classes at runtime.
ava garbage collection is the process by which Java programs perform automatic memory management.

Can you guarantee the garbage collection process?
no

What is the difference between stack and heap in Java?
The major difference between Stack memory and heap memory is that the stack is used to store the order of method execution and local variables while the heap memory stores the objects and it uses dynamic memory allocation and deallocation.

What is reflection in java and why is it useful?
Reflection is a feature in the Java programming language. It allows an executing Java program to examine or "introspect" upon itself, and manipulate internal properties of the program.

what is multithreading in java?
Multithreading refers to a process of executing two or more threads simultaneously for maximum utilization of the CPU.

What is the use of synchronization in Java?
Synchronization in java is the capability to control the access of multiple threads to any shared resource.

What is Framework?
A framework in programming is a tool that provides ready-made components or solutions that are customized in order to speed up development.

What are the testing Framework available in java?
1. JUnit 2. JBehave 3. Serenity 4. Selenium 5. TestNG 6. Mockito 7. HTTPUnit 8. Gauge 9. Geb

Difference between jUnit and testNG?
TestNG is a testing framework that was developed by Cédric Beust. JUnit is an open-source framework used to trigger and write tests. TestNG is a Java-based framework that is an upgraded option for running tests. JUnit does not support to run parallel tests.

What are the dependencies for this project?
MySQL connector, MongoDB connector

what is dependency injection in java?
 transferring the task of creating the object to someone else and directly using the dependency is called dependency injection

What is static binding and dynamic binding?
Static binding is also called late binding because it happens during compilation whereas, dynamic binding is called early binding because it happens during runtime
